# 🚩 Challenge 4: ⚖️ Build a DEX

This challenge will help you build/understand a simple decentralized exchange, with one token-pair (ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH). This repo is an updated version of the original tutorial and challenge repos before it. Please read the intro for a background on what we are building first!

🌟 The final deliverable is an app that allows users to seamlessly trade ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) with ETH in a decentralized manner. Users will be able to connect their wallets, view their token balances, and buy or sell their tokens according to a price formula! Deploy your contracts to a testnet then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on SpeedRunEthereum.com!
